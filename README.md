# cyberbase-frontend-test-react
An interview project remade using React.

Assignment itself can be found in the _assignment.pdf_ file.

It was not made to be optimal, instead it was made with a lot of different hooks (context, reducer, refs, state, etc.) in order to practice using them a bit. Might revise the code a bit in the future, might not.

Current functionality:
* Fetching possible units from a fake "api"
* Adding units
* Filtering per faction using the radio toggles on the top of the page
* Search by any part of name/model/whatever, lowercase or uppercase
* Editing status and conditional formatting of dropdowns (ugly but works)
* Removing units
* State persistence using localstorage



TODO:

* Fix up the UI, it's all over the place and I don't like it atm, but that is secondary
* Make it responsive, also secondary
* Comment and clean up the code a bit for clarity
* Add editing functionality
* Add gear adding functionality
* Probably try doing it with Redux once I learn it
